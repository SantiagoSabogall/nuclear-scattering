### 🔍 Description

In this problem, we analyze a scattering experiment involving a $^9\mathrm{Be}$ beam incident on a $^{64}\mathrm{Zn}$ target at 19 MeV. The experimental yields are measured at several laboratory angles.

The notebook performs the following steps:

- Transform lab angles to center-of-mass frame using the appropriate relativistic formula (valid for \( \lambda < 1 \)).
- Compute the corresponding experimental differential cross sections.
- Compare the results to the analytical **Rutherford scattering formula**:
  $$\left( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \right)_{\text{Ruth}} = \frac{a^2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^4(\theta/2)}$$
- Plot both the experimental and theoretical cross sections for comparison.
